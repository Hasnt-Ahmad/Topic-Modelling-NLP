# Topic-Modelling-NLP

**Topic Modelling with Gensim, spaCy, and pyLDAvis**
This project demonstrates Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on product reviews. The analysis focuses on identifying the underlying topics in the text data to gain insights into common themes and sentiments.

**Key Features:**
**1.Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is filtered to focus on specific products (e.g., Amazon Echo), and the text data is cleaned, tokenized, and lemmatized using spaCy.

2.**LDA Model:** The LDA model is built using Gensim, where it identifies 10 topics from the processed text data.

**3.Visualization:** The topics are visualized using pyLDAvis, providing an interactive way to explore the discovered topics and their distributions across the documents.

**4.Coherence Score:** The model's performance is evaluated using the Coherence Score, ensuring the topics are meaningful and coherent.
